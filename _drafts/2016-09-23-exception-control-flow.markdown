I set exception into my computer

when implemented my computer AI it started to smell the bad code, as the set_mark raised exception
anytime I tried to remove a move done by the computer

- duplicated didn't sounds the right solution but remove the move yes
I had to create a new method that I used only by my computer remove_mark
