This morning I finish my task about the [echo server](https://github.com/fabientownsend/echoserver)

install and use my [dot file](https://github.com/fabientownsend/echoserver)
vim
tmux
iterm2

Grad a meal with Rabea and Priya
it was really tasty but really technical


This afternoon I checked my Echo Server with Christoph
we done some modification where I used some global variable, which is something to avoid

after then I had to implement and test something similar to the cli cat
as the method work I couldn't figure out how to write its tests
