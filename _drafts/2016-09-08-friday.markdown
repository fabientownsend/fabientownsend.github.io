It is the end of my first week at 8th Light, and what a week! 
Fridays are really special at 8th Light
as it is really different from any other working day.

I was surprised this morning when Enrique ask me if I could pair with one
of our guests. Do I know how to do that? It's my first week at 8th Light!
I quickly decided to apply the ping pong rule.
The rule dictates that one person writes a test and then the other person has to solve this test.
We then invert the roles so that both people get an opportunity to write tests and solve them.
We improved the design and the quality of the software by exchanging our ideas.

We worked on my Tic-Tac-Toe, which was quite challenging as both of us didn't have much experience with Ruby.
We managed to beat this challenge. I wish I could tell you that it was technical skill, but it was just determination.

We also had three workshops during the day. They were about:
- Communication
- Consulting
- Deadline

Those weren't only interesting, they were really funny.
I also noticed that I can become confused by a new word in a conversation or when
it's noisy. I feel that I become reserved when this happens as I don't want to
sounds stupid. I know that it's important to try even when I am out of my comfort zone.
I need to find a way to get rid of this feeling.

The day finished with a BBQ on the roof, but I sadly had to pass this time.
I really needed a nap at this point!
