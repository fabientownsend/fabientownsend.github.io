Zagaku! What is a Zagaku already? It's a presentation done everymorning during
like 30 minutes. The purpose is to growth our knowledge and culture.
The subject is free, it can be as much computer sience or blog editing.

Yesterday, the subject was initialised by Daniel about compilaters. He drawn us
a big picture of the subject including the operating system notion.
It openned some new topic that we could have for our next Zagaku.

- Garbage collector
- CPU architecture
- VM vs Compilater
- Memory allocation
- Debugger

Today Uku take over the subject, he describe us the differente steps when it's
come to compile, and where the biggest difference come those three cathegory

- System (C/C++, Rust, Assembler)
- Architectural (C#, Java, Erlang, ...)
- Application (Ruby, Python, JavaScript, ...)


at the end, we could really tell what differency language like Ruby, Java and C.
