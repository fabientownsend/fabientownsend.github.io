Today it was my first IPM with Christophe. It'as planed every week,
it's a one to one during which we can speak about the apprenticeship
check the evolution of the project and coste the next tasks.

I started the last week my Tic Tac Toe, it's not my first itteration
as I done it during my interview. It's the first time I do it with ruby

It turn to be a code review
