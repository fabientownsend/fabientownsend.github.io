I have just started to learn about cryptogaphy. I don't know much so far,
but I want to share what I have learnt so far in order to improve my understanding.

Let's start with a new operator, XOR also called *exclusive or*.
Developers should be familiar with both: OR and AND operators.
Here are some example of these operators:

```
true AND true = true
true AND false = false
false AND true = false
false AND false = false

true OR true = true
true OR false = true
false OR true = true
false OR false = false
```

Here is the behaviour of XOR:

```
true XOR true = false
true XOR false = true
false XOR true = true
false XOR false = false
```

Now, let's convert these boolean with binary values.
This will be useful for the next few examples.

```
1 XOR 1 = 0
1 XOR 0 = 1
0 XOR 1 = 1
0 XOR 0 = 0
```

Let's use a more concrete example based on: Plaintext XOR Key = [Cyphertext](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/ciphertext).
What is the cyphertext of 3 if the key is 5? First step, get the binary value
of our plaintext and the key:

3 = 0011
5 = 0101

0011 XOR 0101 = 0110

and not we can convert the result into an integer:

0110 = 6

So, 3 XOR 5 = 6. We can also convert the Cyphertext into the original plaintext form with the same key.


If you aren't excited by this way to encrypt and decrypt integer values, think
that characters are integers and strings are an array of integers!

This post is based on what I learnt through [Crypto101](https://www.crypto101.io/)

Note: all these examples can be easily tested with irb by converting the *XOR* value by *^*.
