I receive new tasks from my mentors each week. These tasks always involve
implementing new features for the same project. These additions make the project
become bigger and bigger: more files, more code, more functions.

Before I start to code, I always consider how to best implement a new feature or
a new function. Unfortunately, I often feel that my previous choices complicate the
new implementation. It can be frustrating to start a new task with this feeling.

So, why did I implement this feature this way? How could what seemed like a good choice
become so rubbish?

Previously implementation was correct or, at least, it worked. Now that I am adding new features
the requirements of the project are changing and previous 'good decisions' don't seem to mesh
well with new features.

I think at some point I should embrace the problem instead of wasting time wondering why
I made other decisions previously. These decisions were correct in the moment.
I should focus on solving how to implement the new features and enjoy the challenge.
