During my IPM last Friday, I presented the project's latest features, some
interface improvements and the computer player implementation.
Unfortunately, this presentation didn't go the way I had expected.

My tasks had been implemented in my project, but I was under prepared.
This lack of preparation resulted in an awkward presentation in which
the features didn't work.

Whatever the reasons were that made this presentation look terrible, the
result was that I didn't deliver and it could make me lose a customer's trust.

Here are some points that I could improve upon in order to avoid repeating
this situation:

- do not trust manual tests.
- write more integration tests.
- write down how I will execute my presentation and the expecations of this.
- present my work to another person before presenting my mentors.
