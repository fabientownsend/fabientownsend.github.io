During my IPM, I received a new task: preparing a talk. The rules are simple:
I have two days to prepare a 15 minute talk about a subject of my choice.

This challenge will push me out of my comfort zone. I'm not used to talking in
front of people. It will also be the first time that I perform a presentation
in English - that's pretty stressful!

I haven't fixed my mind on asubject yet, but I think talking about *design as a
software crafter* could be great. As soon as I have a draft of the content, I
will ask Christoph for as much feedback as possible in order to learn as much
as I can so I can give a great talk.
