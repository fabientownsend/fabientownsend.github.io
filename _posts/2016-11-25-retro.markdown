I gave my first talk in English on Friday. So, let's talk about my thoughts and
feedback that I received which could help me next time.

I didn't faint and the talk went pretty well. In fact, people seemed to enjoy
the subject. How awesome is that? OK, I don't feel I was amazing, but, it's a
common feeling after experiencing a stressful situation. It could have went
better but then we need to remember that we aren't objective.  I asked for
feedback from Christoph and Enrique. Here are the main comments I received:

- Speak slower during the presentation
- Make transitions obvious in order to help the audience to know where we are in a presentation
- The slides should reinforce the transition and points
- Have a stronger conclusion
- Take a glass of water as it can help to fill the blanks

In addition, here are some ways that I feel could help me to improve:

- Test the material I will use for the presentation
- Train for my presentation **with** the slides
- Make sure I can see what the current slide is
- Not to be dependent on my notes; as soon as I started to read, I felt it was hard to stop

I plan to keep working on improving this skill as it can be fun to train and
useful not only for a public speech, but whenever you have to communicate.
