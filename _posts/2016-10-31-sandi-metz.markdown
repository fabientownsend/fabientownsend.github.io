![practical object-oriented design in ruby cover]({{ site.url }}/assets/oop.jpg)
At 8th Light, we learn by working through a series of tasks in small-middle
sized projects. Practice makes perfect, but we also need to make sure that the
theory is great too. For this,  books, videos and conversation are great
resources to help us learn from others. These experiences that are documented
in conversation, in print, or digitally help us to learn from other people's
previous work, gives us an opportunity to avoid mistakes and gain knowledge faster.

Last week, I watched a talk by [Sarah Mei at the WindyCityRails](https://windycityrails.com/videos/2015/#2)
convention in order to help me improve my understanding of the SOLID principles.
During this presetation, Sarah recommended Sandi Metz's book *Practical Object-Oriented
Design In Ruby* as a excellent book to read for people who are learning good
practice with OOP. I will let you know what I think about it once I have read it.

What a coincidence! Today I watched a video that my mentors recommended and
I realised that the speaker was Sandi Metz. I'm happy to also find the book
in 8th Light's bookshelf.

Here is below the list of the chapters:

- Object-Oriented-Design
- Designing Classes with a Single Responsibility
- Managing Dependencies
- Creating Flexible Interfaces
- Reducing Costs with Duck Typing
- Acquiring Behavior Through Inheritance
- Sharing Role Behavior with Modules
- Combining Objects with Composition
- Designing Cost-Effective Tests

The first four chapters will really helpful as they touch upon issues that
I have already confronted in my project. I really enjoyed her talk and now,
I can't wait to read her book.
