In my previous post, I spoke about storytelling. I spoke about the positive impact that storytelling can have in your blog post and/or speech. After this post, I was asked: "how can emotions be integrated into a blog post and/or a presentation"? This is the subject of this new blog post.

The emotions I spoke about were:

- Sadness
- Joy
- Fear
- Disgust
- Anger

But how can you express them through a blog post or a speech?

## From an Expression to an Emotion
It is important to understand, know and exploit your communication medium. Let's take the example of an omission. But, what is an omission and how can we express it in different mediums?

According to Cambridge Dictionary, an omission is an act of not including something or someone that should have been included.

For example, you can express an omission with a pause when you are talking, you can use an ellipsis when you are writing or you can leave a blank space if you are drawing . 
 
 You may now wonder how someone can express an emotion from an omission. Let's use the example of a scary movie to explain. 
 Which option is the scariest?

 1 -  the movie that shows you when and where the villain will strike.
 2 - the movie that omits those details and lets your imagination expect the worst?

 I bet the second one is the option that would produce the most fear for the majority of people. The movie Alien is a good example.

## How to Build Emotion Effectively
Whenever you communicate a story and build an emotion, you should be able to answer these two questions:

- Which emotion am I communicating?
- Is the emotion obvious enough? 

One of the biggest mistakes in communication is to make an assumption. You can't assume exactly what people will understand from your communication. To make it clear, I will repeat my thought again: you CANNOT assume that people understand you!

For this reason, you should make your communication simple and obvious. In other words, do not leave any room for error.

 You have a lot of tools that you can use to achieve this. For example, you can use the following for your presentation:

 - The volume of your voice
 - The speed of your voice
 - Silence
 - Gestures
 - Your slides
 - Your dress

 You can use the following when writing:
 - Punctuation
 - The wording
 - Vocabulary
 - Illustration

 Imagine yourself on a stage explaining a difficult situation that happened to you. You want to communicate the fear that you felt.

 With a low voice, you can say something like:
 "Last week, during a meeting with a customer..." Take a few seconds to pause and then say: "I was scared". Following this, you could display a black and white slide that says "I was scared".

 This isn't subtle. The aim is to be obvious and efficient; you are not only delivering a story to your audience but who you are as a person. By doing this, you give the audience an opportunity to empathise with you.

 I hope this article gave you a rough idea of how you can communicate emotions through your blog post and/or presentation.
