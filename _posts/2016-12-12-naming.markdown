Here we are, it's my fourth post about naming, and I'm still searching to
improve the name for my variables, methods and classes that I use.
Here the new astuces that I found.

Let's start with some reading. I found into the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)
a section dedicated to the naming which give some good advice. Here what we can
read:

**Classes & Interfaces**
> Class names are typically nouns or noun phrases. For example, Character or
ImmutableList. Interface names may also be nouns or noun phrases (for example,
List), but may sometimes be adjectives or adjective phrases instead (for
example, Readable)

**Methods**
> Method names are typically verbs or verb phrases. For example, sendMessage or stop.

**Parameter Names**
> One-character parameter names in public methods should be avoided.

Note that, those advices are similar to *Clean Code*.

Another astuce that I find helpful. During my apprenticeship I spend most of
my time exposed to my own code, so, I miss the opportunity to be influenced by
better than me. Here is what I do now, reading open source code!

A quick researche and you can find high quality code whish had wrote by
high qualified engineer and reviewed.
