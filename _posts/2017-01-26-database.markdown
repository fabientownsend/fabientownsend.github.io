Today I come up with some difficulty about database, how the best way to
save our data? I have no idea!

The data that we have to save is meals, each meal belongs to a person which can
be a crafter or a guest and finally, each guest belong to a crafter. How do I
do that? I realised that my knowledge about database is really limited.

And to be honest, with an ORM involved it doesn't helped, as I know it can
produce really bad SQL request if it not used carefully.

In order to have a better idea how I could understand and find out a *solution*
I started to drawn some design on the whiteboard with Andrea. We find different
solutions:

- Map the entire class hierarchy to a single table
- Map each concrete class to its own table
- Map each class to its own table

But still, whish is the best for our case? I fairly don't know yet. I feel like
we will find our solution by simply trying.
