Lately, I felt I have some lack of knowledge about design pattern. I currently
know some of their names and how to implement them, but not where and when use them,
and Frankly, that is no enough to be eficient with them.

I planed to learn 25 design patterns, I will learn their name, when to use them, where
to use them and finally how to implement them. Checkout the list of the 25 desgin pattern
I planed to learn:

- Creational Patterns
-- Abstract Factory
-- Builder
-- Factory Method
-- Object Pool
-- Prototype
-- Singleton

- Structural Patterns
-- Adapter
-- Bridge
-- Composite
-- Decorator
-- Facade
-- Flyweight
-- Private Class Data
-- Proxy

- Behavioral Patterns
-- Chain of Responsibility
-- Command
-- Interpreter
-- Iterator
-- Mediator
-- Memento
-- Null Object
-- Observer
-- State
-- Strategy
-- Template Method
-- Visitor

I plan to let the learning of their implementations as last step of my learning. The reason of that
is if I'm knowledgeable with their names and when to use them, I can easily find their
implementaion.

Here are the resoruce I will use in order to help me to learn that:
- Flash Card [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/)
- [Series of videos (27 videos)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF206E906175C7E07)
- [Sourcemaking](https://sourcemaking.com/design-patterns-and-tips)

I planed to learn those design pattern in 25 deays, on design pattern per day. This sounds quite ambitious but,
it the purpose of a challenge. Isn't?
