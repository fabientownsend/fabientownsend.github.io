Have you ever felt that, you are learning something but you don't really know why?

Like me, you may be a curious person who ends up learning about various subjects.
Sometimes this curiousity leaves you asking yourself *why am I even learning that?*, and finally,
you might even give up. Don't do that! By letting your mind be curious, you might be building a bigger
picture of knowledge, and new knowledge doesn't always relate to what you already know.

So, as a note for myself (maybe even you too): sooner or later different pieces of knowledge will work
together to create a bigger picture.
