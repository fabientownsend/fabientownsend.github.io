Let's talk about two of the most amazing tools that a developer can use: a
notebook and a pen.

So, why are they amazing? These two tools work whatever your operating system
is, whatever the language you are using and they will never deprecate.

For quite a few weeks, I have written and drawn whenever I have had to solve a
problem, or needed to analyse a situation. For example, Jarkyn paired with me
on my project today; the first thing she grabbed wasn't a keyboard and she
didn't started by coding. No, instead she borrowed my notebook! After
she navigated through the code and asked me some questions, she was able to
really help me in a short amount of time.

I'm glad that I have her notes in my notebook. This is a good reminder that
a notebook and a pen are two of the most efficient tools for a developer.
