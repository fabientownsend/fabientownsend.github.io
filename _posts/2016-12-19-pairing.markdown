After I finish developing a feature or a fix, I then create a new pull request
and ask people for feedback. Generally speaking, I can start implementing
suggestions 24 hours after my pull request. This leaves me with 24 hours in
which I can work an another task.

This method creates a problem: if the next task doesn't require the full 24
hours then I have to open another pull request without closing the prvious one.

This is why pairing is fantastic! Both participants benefit from the immediacy
and directness of this experience - you don't have to wait 24 hours to share
your screen! Moreover, the feedback isn't limited to just the code as you can
also discuss the refactoring process, the use of your text editor, etc.

I can't decide which one is better. There are parameters that can make one
better than the other depending on who you are working with and the context of
the situation. One thing is for sure; both are worth trying for the good of your
projects.
