After two months working with Ruby, I'm now moving on to work with Java.
There are the three majors between these langauges in my opinion:

- the language (surprise)
- the text editor
- the build tool

Let's talk about the language. Java is verbose and *explicit* where as
Ruby is *elegant* and *magic*. Does it mean that one is better than the other?
Absolutaly not, but they are both definitely good for different reasons.

Despite its verbosity, I enjoy writing Java code, and I like to having control
over the data and its structure. Another huge advantage with Java is the amount
amount of books and computer science videos that use Java to discus examples.
On the other hand, I like that Ruby is quicker to produce a result without much
setup as Java.

Here is the drama... Since I'm working with Java, I can't use Vim as much as I
would like because it isn't an ideal editor for working with Java. Loads of IDE
can do better job. I picked the one which was the most used at 8th Light, which
is IntelliJ - what a mess! I feel that my productivity has decreased. I'm hopeful
that I will become comfortable using it despite my frustrations.

What about the build tool? I chose Gradle for two reasons:

- *"We do truly feel that Gradle is the best build system for the JVM."* â€“ Justin Ryan, Netflix Engineering Tools Team
- *"I use it for all my projects, it's awesome"* - Felipe Sere, My Mentor

I don't have a strong opinion about it however there was an advantage in that
Rake, Ruby's build tool, had Ruby's syntax. With Gradle, I have to learn another
dynamic language *Groovy*, which might sound annoying; actually, this tool seems
so amazing! I can't wait to learn more about it.
