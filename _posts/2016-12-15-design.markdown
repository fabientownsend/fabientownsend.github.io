I really need to learn about design pattern, that, was my feeling today.

If coding was compared to playing chess, design pattern would be to
know chess's strategy. I know a bit about design pattern,
but if I know some of their names and how to implement a Factory, it's probably
all.

Today I had to create a class, let's call it Observer. The Observer purpose was
to let know to A class if B, C or D class get updated. My implementation work, but I'm
pretty sure that there is a design pattern for that. If I knew this desing parttern
it would help me to work faster and probably to implement in a better way.

Next challenge, improve my knowledge about design pattern.
