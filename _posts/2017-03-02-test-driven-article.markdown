Like me, have you ever felt it difficult to write a blog post?
If it's the case, you may want to try a method that I'm working on;
otherwise, you may have some advice to give me.

Inspired by software development testing, this method has three objectives:
make it easier, funnier and quicker to write a blog post. This method has 5
steps, each of them composed with "unit tests". The "unit tests" has two
objectives: verify that you post matches your vision and make your post better.

Here are the 5 steps:
1. Writing your brief
2. Writing your headline
3. Writing the body of your blog post
4. Writing your second draft
5. Writing your copy

[Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/)
All along those steps, I am also using tools like: [Hemingway](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/)
and [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/). I ask feedback for each of the
iterations.

For the first step, you have to answer 8 questions. The answers will help you
to write a good brief and check if your blog post still matches your vision
after each iteration. We could compare these answers to the expectation of
acceptance test.

Here are the questions:
1. who am I writing for?
2. what does your reader expect from you?
3. what does your reader think before receiving this message?
4. What do you want your reader to think after they have received this message?
5. what do you want your reader to do?
6. what proposition are you making to your reader?
7. how do you back up the promise you have made?
8. which of your reader's other problems will your post solve?

When you have answered the questions, write the brief and ask for feedback.

With your brief done, you can work on your headline and the body of your blog post.
This first draft, helped by the brief, is focus on the content rather than the
grammar. If it still respecting the initial answers you can ask for feedback,
and make sure you communicate that you would like this to be focused on the
content.

Once you have applied the feedback, you can start your second draft. This time
you will have to ask these different questions:

- Is the wording correct?
- Is it simple to understand?
- Do you use active verbs?
- Is the syntax correct?
- Are your sentences short enough?
- Are your paragraphs short enough?

Final step! You have now a way better article, it's now the moment to ask for
the last bit of feedback and modify your copy.

My style - or lack of style - was quite freestyle when I started to write my
blogs at 8th Light. I can't say that writing is my strength, that's why I now
trying to me more studious. My efforts have been helped by this new workflow
and the book 'How to Write Better Copy' by Steve Harrison.

Any feedback about the workflow or the article is the very welcome!
