Wow! After one week at 8th Light, I had my first IPM with Christoph.
An IPM takes place every week; it's an opportunity for an apprentice and his mentor
to talk about the previous week and the next one. We discussed the current tasks
and plan the next one so both of us can track my journey and to optimise my experience.

This one to one is a great occasion to become more familiar with 8th Light's processes.
The objective is to meet their high standards and to prepare to become a crafter.

Christoph did a code review on my Tic Tac Toe project that I started last week.
I am familiar with code reviews as I have done them myself in the past, but 
I'm really impressed with Christoph's ability to do it on the fly.
The code review made me feel that I need to focus more on the quality of my tests.
He also made some interesting suggestions about the design of the software in order
to make it more easy to understand.

I can't wait to commit the modifications!
