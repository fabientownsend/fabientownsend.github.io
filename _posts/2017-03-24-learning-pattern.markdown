If there is one thing I love about software developing, it is the continuous learning. Whenever I want to learn a new skill, I use the same pattern that helps me to master it and I will share it with you in this article.

## The first question
The first question I ask myself before learning anything is whether  I consider it valuable to me in the short term or long term?

The skill can be valuable for different reasons: improving your lifestyle, your career or your happiness. If you can't answer the question then why would it be worth spending time and effort on it or even space in your brain? Arthur Conan Doyle describes it in this way:

> "I consider that a man's brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skillful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these, he has a large assortment and all in a perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones." -  Arthur Conan Doyle, A Study in Scarlet

If you have started to learn a skill and thought it was valuable but later realised it's not, you shouldn't hesitate to stop learning it.

## How do I know where to start to learn?
The second step is crucial. You know you want to learn a skill but you don't know where to start. I often start by researching to find a mentor that excels in this particular skill. This mentor will help you to decide what to learn and what to avoid.

Finding a mentor can seem like an easy job. A mentor can be a colleague, an author, a Youtuber or simply someone on Twitter, but a difficulty remains. How do you know if this person is a good mentor? How can you determine if someone has satisfactory knowledge or if he is a master? Without enough knowledge, you can't really.

Once you have found your mentor, they will be able to help you find resources that will help you achieve your mission. This resource can be constituted by books, videos or whatever works best for you.

## Make it work, make it break
After learning the theory, it's time to put theory into practice. This is an important step and often takes more time to understand and successfully apply the theory. You have to learn how to make it work, but also how to make it break and hack it as well. Here you will learn to apply the theory to practice, ideally to a real case and solve a real life problem.

Let's take learning how to extract a class with the book [Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Technology/dp/0201485672) as an example. The most important step isn't when you are learning how to extract a class through the example, but when you will do it on an actual real project.

This is where both the first and second steps are so important. You will dedicate a lot of time to learn and perfect a skill. If this skill isn't necessary or you aren't using the correct resources then this is a waste of time. We can't take back time and we can't easily gain motivation when we have lost it.

At this point, I don't try to have an opinion about what I'm learning or applying. I 100% trust my mentor and resources. I will build my opinion after some years; it is just a matter of time. When I have enough real life experience, I can start to form my opinion.

# Conclusion
If continuous learning is important, you can't avoid learning how to learn. Throughout this article, you can see that my technique is about:
- Deciding if it worth time
- Finding the best resources
- Practicing

If you have any of your own techniques for learning or advice, don't hesitate to share.
