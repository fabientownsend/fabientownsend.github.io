I'll admit it, writing is one of the most challenging and scary activity for me.
But at the same time, I also enjoy doing it and research how improve my skill.

Recently I found a course on edX about *How to write and Essay*. Here are some
really basic, but it helped me to understand how to construct my sentences:

**Subject**: a person or a thing. It is an imperative.

**Predicates**: this is the part which contains the verb and state something
about the subject.

**Clauses**: the clause contain the *subject* and *predicate*.

There is two types of clauses:

- Independent, can stand by itself
- Dependent, dependent on another clause

**Phrase**: is a group of words. The phrase is either missing a subject, a verb
or both.

Here is a checklist of 6 steps to make a writing more concise:

1. Remove redundancy
2. Avoid wordy phrases. Example: have the ability to => can
3. Make the subject clear.
- The practice of revision would improve.
- Revision would improve.
4. Use strong verbs.
- What we gound was a solution to the problem.
- We solve the problem.
5. Avoid vague words like: thing, stuff, material, people, get or did
6. Romeve unecessary modifier like: many, really, quite, in my opinion, etc

It's not a lot, but for me it's a good start!
