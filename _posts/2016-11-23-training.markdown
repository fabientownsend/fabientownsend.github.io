There are now just two days until my presentation. I wrote 1/2 of the outline,
practiced 1/4 and now, I also have to work on my Java project!

Today, I spent most of my time working on my computer player algorithm. I
finished it with the implementation of Minimax, which I then improved with alpha
beta pruning. I expected to finish my computer player task faster, but I found
it hard to focus knowing that I still hadn't finished the preparation for my
talk. This lack of focus on my task resulted in silly mistakes over and over. I
decided to start everything from scratch again as I felt it would waste less
time.

Next time, I will focus on one and only one task. This will save me precious
time.
