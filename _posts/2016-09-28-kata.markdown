*From a software development perspective, we use katas to build muscle memory,
practice logical thought and teach ourselves familiar ideas but from a
different perspective.* - [from 8th Ligth blog](http://8thlight.com/blog/micah-martin/2013/05/28/performing-code-katas.html)

I trained on with [Roman Numeral Kata](http://agilekatas.co.uk/katas/RomanNumerals-Kata) today.
This is the first time that I'm preparing to perform a Kata. The final objective
is to do it in front of 8th Light's team and in just 8 minutes!

Felipe and Christoph asked me to reccord it when possible in order to check to
see if I'm ready to do it in front of the team.

First step: ask for advice. I explained my situation to Chris and asked if he
had any advice. Here is the advice that he gave me:

- Play music. I have no taste. Should I put Nyan cat?
- Use Guard software, which will help display tests' status.
- Increase the size of my font so that it is easier to read.
- Read this [article about Vim](http://vimcasts.org/blog/2013/02/habit-breaking-habit-making/)

## How I am Preparing Myself
I wrote [a script](https://github.com/fabientownsend/setup_kata_ruby) quickly in the morning.
This script generates the environment needed to perform my kata.
At the moment it:

- Installs RSpec.
- Installs Guard rspec.
- Creates a class and its test.
- Runs Guard rspec.

After 10 attempts today, I'm still far from performing this task in 8 minutes.
I finish at around 14 minutes and that's without the pressure of people
watching me code.
