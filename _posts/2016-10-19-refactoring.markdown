Working with legacy code. This area represent a way to improve the quality
of a project. That's why I need to improve this skill.

After one month working on my Tic-Tac-Toe project, it already had the
opportunity practice this skill.

Here are some examples where I accounter difficulty with my existing project:

- Add new features.
- Make changes without breaking the code.
- Break too big class into smaller.
- Modification with the dependancies.

All decisions I made in my project have now an impact on my productivity.
Wether I implement a new feature or have to do some refactoring.

The only way I see to improve my velocity when it come to work with
an existing project is the practice. I already read [Working Effectively with Legacy Code](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052/)
which talk about this subject,it could be good idea to read it again.
I also heard at 8th Light about Joshua Kerievskyâ€™s Refactoring to Patterns book that I added to my reading list.
