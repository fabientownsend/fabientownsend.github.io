Every week 8th Light organises workshop for their apprentices to develop their knowledge in software development.

Today the theme of the workshop was refactoring and was presented by Dave. He also made us work on a kata in pairs in which I worked Mollie. It was really interesting when it came to challenge our different approaches.

During the workshop Dave allowed us a 'break', except we learnt even more! He taught us about cache. He really caught my attention as he helped us to build a good big picture of the subject. I really want to go deeper in this subject and learn more. What a break! 

One of my tasks this week is to mock the IO commander line of a Ruby program. It's something that I couldn't figure out how to do with Python when I wrote my Tic Tac Toe program for my interview. This task is really an efficient way to learn Ruby for me since I never used it before.

I really like how we can learn in so many different ways. The same problem can have many different solutions. It is just about how to approach the problem. 

Ps: I wrote this post on an iPhone. I do not recommend it.
