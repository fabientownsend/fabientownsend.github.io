*Craft Your Software Like a Designer* - this is my subject for my presentation.
Now that I have found my subject, I need to get prepared. Well, I have no idea
how to get prepared neither how to start. My experience in public speaking is
really poor and I have only two days to get ready.

In order to help me to get preapared I decide to learn with a MOOC that I found
on edX.org: [Introduction to Public Speaking](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-public-speaking-uwashingtonx-comm220x2)

As I am short in term of time, here are the list of the videos I watched from
Matt McGarrity lecturer at University of Washington:

- Design and deliver basic arguments clearly
- Speak confidently with appropriate rate, projection, movement, and vocal variety
- Evaluate and critique speeches insightfully

During on of the video here a structure of the arguments he gave, which will be
really helpful for me:

> ### Introduction
> - Open the speech
> - State thesis statement
> - Preview both main poins
>
> *Transition to main point 1*
>
> ### Main point 1
> - State it
> - Explain it
> - Prove it
> - Conclude it
>
> *Transition to main point 2*
>
> ### Main point 2
> - State it
> - Explain it
> - Prove it
> - Conclude it
>
> *Transition to conclusion*
>
> ### Conclusion
> - Restate thesis and main points
> - Conclude speech

Today, I learnt a lot about public speaking. I need now to apply as much as
possible what I learnt and be confortable with what my talk.
