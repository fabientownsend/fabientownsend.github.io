My mentors recently challenged me to write a blog post and present a lightning
talk every week.  One important skill that helps me to convey messages with an
impact is the skill of storytelling.

I'm pretty new to the world of writing and public speaking, which doesn't make
me feel confident with my work. But, building a story helps me to be more
confident and improve my communication.

Whenever you communicate with people, by writing or talking, you deliver a
message. The question is: how can you increase the impact of your message?

This is where storytelling helps. Your message will probably involve a journey
that has:
- a beginning
- a middle
- and end

You will build a journey that will communicate emotions like:

- Sadness
- Joy
- Fear
- Disgust
- Anger

Why bother building this kind of story? If your message is meaningless and you
don't care if people remember it, fair enough but expect the story to bore your
audience. Alternatively,  using emotional language you can make your audience
empathise with your story and feel more involved/implicated.

You will create a universe composed of a world and (a) character(s). It doesn't
matter if it is fictional or real, in the past, present or future, the world and
the characters are there to highlight your message. This will provide a stage
for your message and make it clear through examples. Your audience will
hopefully find it easier to understand your message and therefore, they are more
likely to remember your message.

If like me, you are interested in storytelling, you can find an MOOC by Pixar:

Will you try to tell a story in your next blog post/speech? If not, what didn't
convince you?
