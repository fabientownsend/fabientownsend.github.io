Zagaku! What is a Zagaku again? It's an opportunity for someone to present a
a subject for around 30 minutes in the morning. The subject is free:
it can be about computer science, blog editing, anything to do with customers,
so on and so forth. The purpose is to grow the team's knowledge.

Yesterday, the subject about compilaters was initialised by Daniel. His talk helped
us to gain a big picture of this topic, including some notion of operating systems.
The subject was so vast that we divided it into smaller topics that will be discussed
in our next Zagaku. Here is a list of some of the smaller topics:

- Garbage collector
- CPU architecture
- VM vs Compilater
- Memory allocation
- Debugger

Uku continued with the subject today, by covering it more in depth. 
He described the different steps of the compilation
, and where the biggest differences come in these three categories of language:

- System (C/C++, Rust, Assembler)
- Architectural (C#, Java, Erlang, ...)
- Application (Ruby, Python, JavaScript, ...)

I feel that's important to keep learning those kinds of subjects. They are
not essential for "just coding", but they are when it comes to becoming a professional.
This knowledge will help me to make better decisions to drive projects and make
them successes.
