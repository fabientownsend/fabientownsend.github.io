I finally managed to make my Tic-Tac-Toe core game work with my desktop GUI
application. Testing the interface isn't as easy as unit testing, it was for
this reason that I kept them for the end. What a terrible idea.

As soon as I started to test my GUI, I could see that my application
wasn't well desgign to be testable. Even worst, I implemented something
called **circular dependency**:

- The class A need the dependency of the class B.
- The class B need the instance of the class A.

In my Tic-Toe-Case case:

- the Core game require to get the instance of the DesktopGUI
- The DesktopGui require to get the instance of the Core game

This required a *complicated* setup in my main, but it's even more complicated
to set up for the tests! At this point I don't know any quick fix to improve
the situation, I will probably need to extract the Core class dependency
from the UI.
