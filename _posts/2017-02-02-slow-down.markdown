Have you ever felt like you are in a tunnel of productivity? It's as though
you feel like you can produce anything in a short amount of time and nothing
can stop you. I certainly have.

But, what if the feeling is an illusion? What if you have missed actioning some
tasks as a result of this 'efficiency'? What if you were actually more harmful
than productive?

In order to avoid the illusion, I tell myself to slow down and I ask myself
these question:

- Are you really addressing the customer's needs?
- Have you updated the documentation?
- Do your Unit/Integration Tests cover all user cases?
- Is the code secure?
- Are the exceptions handled?
- How is the user experience?
- What about the fault tolerance?

Let me know if you think of another question that you feel is important and I
may even add it to my list.
