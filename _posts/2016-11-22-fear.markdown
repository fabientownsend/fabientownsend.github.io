![notes for my speak]({{ site.url }}/assets/notes_speak.jpg)
Today, I'm preparing my presentation for my talk on Friday. I have picked my subject
and its outline, but I still need to practice in order to avoid panicking. I
can tell that that I'm not ready and this feeling influences my confidence in
the bad way.

In the MOOC that I'm watching, the lecturer talks about a *funny* and awkward
story in which a person is stressed during her presention.

It's a true story that takes place in a public speaking class where the students had to
introduce themselves on stage. During one presentation, a student panicked and
found that she couldn't say anything due to stress. The teacher attempted to
encourage her, but this made it even worse. The student then crawled under a
piano on the stage! The teacher tried to get her to come out but nothing worked.
They had to turn off the lights and leave the classroom. The other students
never saw her again.

This story is terrible, moreover when you realise that 8th Light doesn't have a
piano where I could potentially hide. Here two alternatives I can think of:

- Ask Amelia to order a piano for Friday, but this seems complicated due to the
delivery delay.
- See this challenge in a more positive light.

Here is some advice provided by the lecturer:

- Become used to speaking situations
- Change the way I think about the public speaking
  - Speak naturally
  - Visualise yourself doing well
- Train

English isn't my native language. So, the first point is already a challenge I'm
working on whenever I have to talk in front of more than two people. I guess now
I have to focus on the two last points.
