For our new lunch bot project we deploy our Sinatra on Heroky.

Neither Will nor me ever used Sinatra and Heroky before. In order to
be get a project and learn those new tools as soon a possible,
we started to code straight away. Those tools are really well documented
which is pretty helpful. This make me think that we should document our
project as well!

In addition I watched two tutorial from [udacity](https://udacity.com/)
dedicated to Sinatra and Heroku. As there videos are hosted on YouTube
you can even watche them on speed x1.5, which save a good way to save
some times!
