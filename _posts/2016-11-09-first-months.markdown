One of the things I love about 8th Light is the culture of learning and
sharing our knowledge. I recently finished my Ruby Tic-Tac-Toe projects,
it made me work arround the SOLID principles, package principle, oriented-object
programming and testing software.

Here are 3 import things I learnt during the challenge which up my software
skills.

1. **Later Is a Shortcut For Never** everything should be done as you go. I
caught myself delaying some little tasks like fault managing, a test, etc.
I built an iceberg of tasks that could be even more difficult because they
doesn't belong to any other story.

> Cost-Benefit: An activity will be pursued only if its benefits are equal to
or greater than the costs.

2. **Build Your Own Toy** I used to be an user of web framework, without no
idea about how it's work, struggling to fix it when I broke it. I realised how
*fast* and *easy* you can make this magic gone. Build a simple version of those
tools. Trust me, you will feel really better when you realise it's just about
input and output, nothing more.

3. **Dependencies is Hard to Maintain**
Whenever you will change a variable, method, classes, extention name this
will imply to do modification to everything depend on it. When it's in the
same project it's pretty easy with an IDE but, when you depend on external
repository or external dependencies it can be quickly a night mare to maintain.
