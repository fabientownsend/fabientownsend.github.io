In a previous post, I talked about the refactoring that I did on my Tic-Tac-Toe project.
I was satified with it. Three days later, I realised I made wrong decisions
when refactoring.

During the refactoring, I managed to extract private methods into a new class
with its tests. I made this decision thinking that:

- This method could be used by other classes.
- I didn't want to delete its tests.

During my IPM, Christoph and Felipe pointed out that
firstly, no other classes needed to use this method, so I had no reason to
expose it for this sprint. As this method wasn't public, its tests aren't
needed as I had thought.

It's the first time that I have had to go backward on my project. Lesson learnt:
over design is as bad as under design.
