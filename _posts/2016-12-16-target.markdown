This week I planned to learn JavaFX and create a desktop Tic-Tac-Toe
application with JavaFX for my apprenticeship. Unfortunately, I didn't meet the
target. Why?

I thought my week was going pretty well until Wednesday. In reality, my
missunderstanding of the JavaFX framework was too great to enable me to finish
my task on time.

Other than coding, I did the following to help me achieve my goal:

- Attempt to understand the situation with class diagram and sequence diagram
- Ask for help from someone who has used the framework
- Spend more time than expected on the task

This helped me with my task however, it wasn't enough to help me to achieve my
goal in time for my IPM presentation.

Even if I'm disappointed, this week made me realise that I shouldn't
underestimate the time dedicated to learn a new tool.
