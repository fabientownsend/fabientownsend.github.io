The ability to examine trade offs and make good decisions are key skills for excellent crafters.
Trade offs can have a direct impact on deliveries and the overall cost of a project. 
They are also great opportunities to influence the satisfaction of a customer.

My question today was: 

when you have *done* a task, should you start the refactoring of this task straight away
then jump to the next task? Or, should I concentrate on refactoring only when all of the tasks are complete?

Felipe rephrased the question by asking:

> "Could I ship this TODAY and give the client a tangible benefit/value? That also includes NOT getting penalties. E.g. if we ship it next week, we have to pay Â£5 million in penalties and we are out of business."

> "The other factor: if I don't refactor/clean it now, how much slower will I move in future? What does it cost ME as the developer to not fix it now."

When you have to confront a problem without any experience or instinct of how to solve it,
it can make you feel frustrated. Especially when you are close to the deadline.
In this situation, I try to stay focused on the key inputs and deliver the right quality for the due date.
