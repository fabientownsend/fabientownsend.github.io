Have you ever struggled to find a good name for your variables, methods or classes?
Lately, I have received quite a bit of feedback surrounding this issue in my pull requests.
That's why I have promised to explore this issue this week.

Good names are necessary; they communicate your intention to other developers, and state the
context of the content and document the code. This will result to a software easier to
maintain. But how can I make a name informative and avoid to interpretation or hesitation.

Here are some example of name improvement:

Avoid wordy pharses
```
repeatElement(totalCharBoardWidth(board), INTER_LINE)
```
vs
```
repeatElement(widthOf(board), LINE_SEPARATOR)
```

Use strong verb:
```
Problem solvedProblem = SolutionToTheProblem(problem);
```
vs
```
Problem solvedProblem = Solve(problem);
```

Avoid vague words:
```
String sentence = Serialiser(sentence)
```
vs
```
String serialisedSentence = Serialiser(sentence);
```

During the week, I will use these different ressources and write about it.
