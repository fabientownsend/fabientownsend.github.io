Here we are, after two months after have working with Ruby it's time for me to
learn Java. Wikipedia's description of Java made me realise how different Java
is completly different compared to Ruby, let's check how much.

Here what I just read on Wikipedia:

> Java is a dance which was developed in France in the early part of the 20th
century. The origin of its name is uncertain, but it probably evolved from the
valse.

Joke aside, I don't know yet how different are those languages.
The only different that I know so far it's that Ruby is a dynamic language
mainwhile Java is a static language running on a *JVM*.

Here is my current status:

- IntelliJ IDE installed
- Java 8 installed
- Gradle 3.1 installed
- 60% of the Java'koans done

I can't wait to start to craft a software with this new language.
