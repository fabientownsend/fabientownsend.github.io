![uml language from my notbook]({{ site.url }}/assets/uml.jpg)
My current goal is to improve the way I articulate the design of my projects.
At the moment, I don't have any proper technique. Maybe it's the
right moment to learn UML? Learning this language could really help me achieve
my goal.

Here is Wikipedia's definition of UML:

> The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general-purpose, developmental,
modeling language in the field of software engineering, that is intended to
provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system.

It's also a great time to improve my communication skills.
After drawing a *class diagram* or a *sequence diagram*, I could ask a peer
what is their opinion of the diagram, consult with them about problems and
learn from their feedback. Of course, this exercise will help me to clearly
articulate the thoughts in my mind as I navigate through the diagram.

I have challenged myself to spend 10 minutes each day to draw a *class diagram*
and a *sequence diagram* from my current project until I feel really comfortable
to draw and describe them.
