Oh noes, I broke my pipeline. How I have done that?

I broke my pipeline on Thursday, before my IPM. I was disappointed because I
configurated my Git to run my tests before each push. So, how did it happen?

Let's talk about my Git configuration.
I created a file:
> ./.git/hooks/pre-push

With this content:

{% highlight ruby %}
!#/bin/bash

echo "running RSpec"
bundle exec rspec spec

spec=$?
if [ $spec -eq 0 ]; then
 exit 0
else
 echo -e "Tests failed. Use git push --no-verify to force the push\n"
 exit 1
fi
{% endhighlight %}

Note that the file must be in: *chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push*

The problem occured when I attempted a pull request on Github.

As we can see /travis-ci/pr was broken.

I couldn't understand why it was broken and I couldn't find any explanation.
I tried everything and anything; I even used a few of Git's commands that I
never thought would be useful. Nothing helped.

During my IPM, I mentioned what happened and that I hadn't found a solution
despite spending quite a bit of time trying to solve it.
My mentors suggested an explanation as to why it didn't work. My server runs with
Linux when I'm working with MacOS. How did I not even think about that?

Sometimes a quick chat can really help to find a solution that we couldn't imagine.

I still have to explore this suggestion, but I hope that a future post will detail
the solution.
