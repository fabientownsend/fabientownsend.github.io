Well, there we are. I just finished my 5th Tic-Tac-Toe story. This means that the game
is ready for my next IPM on Monday, and I have time to polish my code. It's always better
to have time to do this.

# How to Set Up Continuous Delivery
Since I started I 8th Light, I have gotten into the habit of setting up Continuous Delivery on my projects.
One reason to do this is because today it's easy and free to do with tools like Travis and Coveralls.
Another reason to do this is that for each push, all the project will be recompiled and all of its tests will be launched.
Those tools will help me with my testing.

# Test Coverage
Testing isn't easy and maintaining it will be even more complicated. Still, it worth it.
Here are some reasons:

- Avoid manual tests which is highly time consuming
- Improves the design of the code
- Guarantees the functionality of the code
- Documents the code

Oh, I nearly forgot to mention that with my last commit [I reached 100% test coverage](https://coveralls.io/github/fabientownsend/tic-tac-toe?branch=master).
