Yesterday I wrote about *Cracking the Coding Interview*'s exercise: a new activity
for 8th Light's apprentices. I have written my feedback below as we did our first exercise today.

Andrea and I worked on this problem:

> Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you
cannot use additional data structures?

The problem itself isn't complicated, but the solution can be surprising. Andrea grabbed the pen
and worked on the question. I knew the answers, so I participated in this way:

- set the problem
- answer questions
- ask questions in order to give clues if needed
- ask questions to test skills

I was really surprised by Andrea's examples and the interesting solutions that he provided.

As an observer of this exercise, I learnt about problem solving in a different way.
I could see a *mistake* that I also make: imagining different viable solutions, but instead
of picking up one, keep trying to search for a better one. At first, it's better to come with
a unoptimised solution than none at all. The solution can then be analysed and optimised later.

This exercise was also interesting as, simply, an excellent opportunity to share with someone
else and learn from them.

If you are interested in the solution to the problem then please don't hesitate to discuss with
Andrea or myself.
