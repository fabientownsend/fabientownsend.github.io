8th Light was kind enough to let me invite a friend to join me on Friday.
This was really important to me as I consider him to be my first mentor; he
taught me how to program two years ago. How exciting is that?

I was really proud to show him where I work, to introduce him to the team and
demonstrate the company's way to work. He is passionate about creating quality
software and we are too. That's why my mentor Felipe, my friend Brice and I
worked on refactoring a part of my project.

This refactoring was quite challenging as it impacted a lot of classes
and required a lot of modification. I felt stuck when it came to find
some solutions at times and presented my thoughts to peers.

I can tell that Felipe was comfortable presenting his thoughts; he *just*
grabbed a pen, started to explain and drew a plan on the whiteboard.
Brice used the same technique to break down problems without coding first.
Instead, they both explained their thoughts using the whiteboard.

I was impressed with their communcation skills. I was pretty
terrible! Now the question is how can I improve this ability?
Doing more pair programming could be a good start.
