The Single responsibility also well know as SRP. It's the first
of the SOLID principles. The Single Responsibility Principle says:

> A module should have one and only one reason to change one, and only one, responsibility.

The needs from software's users can change often.
But sometimes, it's complicated to make these changes because it impacts
a lot of differents classes and make it difficult to meet the new users needs.

Here is the idea of the SRP, make a software to folerate and facilitate to any changes.
For that we have to keep all responsabilities separate from each other.

If the SIP is well respected. When it come to making a change for an actor the code
will be located in one place which concern this actor. For example: if I have to
do a modification to my Board class which is in a Gem none of the projects
using this Gem should have to be modified.

Note: the SIP can also apply to your commit and pull request.
