This week I'm working on a desktop Tic-Tac-Toe project, and for that I'm using
the framework JavaFX. How can I reuse the code from my command-line Tic-Tac-Toe
project?

This scenario isn't really new: I previously wrote a command-line Tic-Tac-Toe
project with Ruby and this was followed by a web version. This gave me the
opportunity to avoid repeating previous mistakes such as writing temporary code
just in order to check that it's working. Instead, I will create a library from
the start and use it in the new project.

This may seem like a waste of time now, but this will benefit me in the future.
Saving time, the ability to test the library immediately and improve the
cleanliness of the project - who can argue with that?!

In order to create a library, I have to learn how to create, use a package with
Java and configure the build tool. My first impression is that it seems more
complicated to do this with Java than with Ruby.
