Here I am. After two years of learning to Code and learning English, I start my apprenticeship at the incredible company 8th Light in London.
It's been 13 days since I moved to England and today I'm really excited as it's my first day at 8th Light.

This morning began with a presentation of the apprenticeship by Christophe, who is one of my mentors.
The intensive program is really focused on each individual as it is designed to challenge our own weaknesses and to improve a group of skills.
I hesitated to write the word weaknesses because it sounds too negative. Weaknesses are chances to grow our knowledge.

Later, I attended my first Zagaky. A Zagaky is a presentation done by a crafter or an apprentice for 30 minutes.
This morning it was done by Rabea, who presented to the team how to track a bug using **git bisect**. It was really interesting.

During this day, I also got my first task for my first week. I will have to write a short daily blog post and a bigger one each week that is more focus on technical skills.
I'm really excited by this challenge because writing isn't my strengh, moreover, in English. But, it's really a great opportunity to make a change.

The second task will be to write a Tic Tac Toe game. I did it for my interview but this time in Ruby.
I don't have any experience with Ruby but Christoph recommended two books and a website to me, which could help me.

They are:

* Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby
* Eloquent Ruby
* [RubyTapas](www.rubytapas.com)

During the day, Christophe and Jim explained to me how important and strong the 8th Light culture and customer obssesion are. 

I'm really excited for the journey and can't wait to know more about the team.
