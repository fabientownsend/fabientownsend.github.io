Today is my third one to one with my mentors, Felipe and Christoph. Wait, what?
Three people? It can't be one to one! Let's try again.
Today is my third IPM with...

During my IPM, I spoke about my previous week, how it went
and presented my tasks. I hoped to focus on the presentation of my project
this time. For that, I split the idea of 'presentation' into two parts:

- Customer Presentation
- Developer Presentation

## Customer Presentation
This presentation gave me the opportunity to introduce the new features that we
had previously planned. I displayed my unbeatable computer player and the new
language menu.

The weekly meeting is also an occasion for the customers to add a
new request or modifications on the current implementation.

This part was done pretty quickly, which is crazy when I compared it to the 
time I took to implement it!

Note that for the exercise the customers are my mentors.

## Developer Presentation
For this part, I tried to be more organised than the previous time.

Before my presentation I:
- ran my tests in front of my mentors
- opened my code before the meeting into different windows
- prepared questions

I feel more confortable with this part, even if I have a lot to improve.
The direct feedback that I receive during my IPM  makes me feel
satisfied and I look forward to being productive.

## Conclusion
List of things I want to improve after this IPM:

- Communicate more whenever I have a question. Not only with Google.
- Improve my way to present. I feel sorry already for my colleagues ears. :D
- Keep improving my writing.
