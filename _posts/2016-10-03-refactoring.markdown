Have you ever felt 'slow' when learning something new or, at least, stuck?
It happens to me all the time, but I have found a way to deal with it.
It's worth remembering that people learn in different ways and therefore,
individuals have different learning styles. So my method may not completely
work for you, but you might find some of it helpful.

For more than one year, I have adopted a learning 'habit'.
I regulary write down my goals and review them. Simple. This helps me
to remain focused by tracking my progress, reflect on my learning and archive
my goals.

Here is a list of just a few goals that I am currently focusing on:

- Finish reading the book about Git.
- To be more knowledgable about SOLID Principles.
- Do more code review.
- Improve my typing.
- Finish watching the first season of [Destroy All Software](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts).

I like to take stock of my learning; this activity is valuable and time effective.
I can write my goals on paper, on my iPhone or a whiteboard - it doesn't really
matter! The idea is to physically process this information so that I can mentally
focus. This activity motivates me and inspires me to take action everyday, even
if I dedicate just a few minutes to one goal. I can regularly monitor my progress
and this helps to defeat the feeling of being 'slow' or stuck.
