This week, I'm working on the web implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe project.
I imagined that it would be easy but, frankly, it's not a piece of cake. I
have to work with three projects at same time: command line, web and core.

The web version of the Tic-Tac-Toe project has a lot in common with the command
line version. That's why I started to create a Gem last week.
This Gem is supposed to contain the common parts that both versions share.
Doing this, allows me to avoid the duplicating code and therefore, makes
the projects easier to maintain.

It sounds simple, but here are the difficulties that I have already encountered:

- I duplicated code between the web and command line version.
- Some encapsulations aren't easily reusable between both projects.
- Refactoring the three projects is time consuming.

I can feel my lack of engineering experience with the mistakes I have made.
On the other hand, it's really constructive.
