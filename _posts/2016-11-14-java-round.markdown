Today, I worked on my first Java project. The EchoServer project is a basic
project, and it's also a good way to learn how to work and mock the IO system
with this language.

With this first project, I will be writing my first lines of code in Java, its tests and
the Gradle's configuration. I will also start to use IntelliJ IDE as Vim isn't
the best tool for editing Java. I realised that I didn't even know how to launch
my application through my command line as I was applying TDD. I will have to
manually test my application but my tests' coverage left me feeling pretty
confident about the correctness of the behavior of my application.

I still have to set up the pipeline with Travis and Coveralls.
After that, my project will be ready to be reviewed and these reviews will
indicate as to where I improve my project.
