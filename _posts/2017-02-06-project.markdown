I recently started a new side project in which I hope to improve my ability to
teach others.

Since I started learning to code two years ago, I'm lucky enough to have had
amazing mentors. I wouldn't be where I am today without their teaching and
guidance. That's why I now want to start to share what I have learnt.

If I found my way to learning and understanding different subjetct,  I still
need to find my way to share my knowledge. That's why I will work on this
abilty in different ways: hosting some code on Github, writing explanations,
ucreating YouTube videos, etc. By exploring these different paths, I hope to
find the one I feel most comfortable working in.

[Here is a Github where I explain data structures](https://github.com/fabientownsend/learn_algo_with_ruby)
