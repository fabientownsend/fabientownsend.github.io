Happy New Year! This is my first post in 2017 after a one week
break.

In one of my last posts I spoke about a challenge that I am working on:
learning design patterns. So far, so good. I now know:

- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Method Factory
- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite

Most interestingly, I learnt that the implementation of a design pattern
depends on the language and certain pattterns can have the same purpose.
Of course, what you implement will depend on the state of the project.
