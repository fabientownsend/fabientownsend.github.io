How is it even possible that the week is nearly finished? This week was intense
as I had to learn new abilities and continue with my  Java project. This could
explain why the week passed so quickly.

The main subjects I learnt/improved on this week at 8th Light are:

- Writing
- Preparing a presentation
- Object Oriented Programming
- TCP/IP

During my commute, I also learnt about these subjects:

- Algorithm
- Data Structure
- Problem Solving

My tasks are mostly about OOP. I wonder if I should spend more time
studying it. There are so many exciting subjects in computer science;
it's really hard to stay focused on only one!
