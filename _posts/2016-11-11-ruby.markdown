![c extension for ruby]({{ site.url }}/assets/c.jpg)
My mentors have asked me to write my next project with Java, but I still have
some experiments that I want to try with Ruby.

I enjoyed Ruby as it's quick to set up a project and pleasant to use.
For me, it is an ideal language to play with and that's why I want to
try these experiments with Ruby.

Here are the three projects that I want to do:

1. **A Web Framwork**
After my web Tic-Tac-Toe, I want to write a MVC web framework and have a better
understanding of how a framework like [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) or
[Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) really works.

2. **A Website**
After the MVC web framework has been implemented, I want to create a website
with a well-known framework. I still don't know if I will try Sinatra or Ruby
on Rails.

I will probably then host it on my dedicated server or [Heroky](https://www.heroku.com).

3. **A C Extension for Ruby**
I quickly tried a basic C extension for Ruby. Now, I would like to try to write
something that makes sense to be written in C in order to understand Ruby and
its limits.
