As software crafters, we are surrounded by principles, rules, methodologies
and so on.

To name a few, we have the SOLID Principles, DRY, TDD, Design Pattern, Agile,
etc. All of these exist in order to help us to improve our work, right? But,
there is a down side to all of this: is our decision based on our own
conviction or on these principles?

Don't get me wrong, we must learn and know them, but we should never disconnect
our brain. None of these are **laws**, which means that ou can overule them if
we think that they don't fit well with our solution.

Never forget that at the end of the day we are always the one that makes the
decisions.
