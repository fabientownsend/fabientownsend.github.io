One of the best way to improve your skill as a software crafter is to do a code review. With code review,
you can learn all the aspects that compose a sofware by practicing.

The time consumed by doing a code review is usually seens as a con.
But code reviews have a lot of benefits for the:

- Writer
- Reader
- Software

And, by definition, the customers.

## As the Writer
As the writer, you actually have to ask people to review your code. Easy, right? If you don't ask, you don't get.
You also have to turn off your [superego](https://www.britannica.com/topic/superego).
This will let you and your reviewers focus on improving the software.
To increase the benefits of this exercise, you have to understand the feedback that you recieve and its
intention. It's the perfect occasion to ask questions if you don't.

## As a Reader
When you read a code wrote by someone else you have to understand it and the person's intention.
This code can be from an open source project on Github or as we do it at 8th Light, requested by a colleague.
The differents points that you review could be:

- Style (extra spaces, extra line, naming, code by intention, etc)
- Architecture (design pattern, over design, under design, POO, scalability, etc)
- Logique (test coverage, data structure, algorithm, bugs, etc)

By doing this, you will have the opportunity to go deeper into these subjects. You might come across problems
that you never had to resolve before and also, you will sharpen your skills.

## The Software
It would be completelly silly to imagine publishing a book without any reviews before.
With the impact that software has, it should also be the same.
