When I started to code, the first book I read was Clean Code.
But, why writing clean code? How does it matter?

It does matter if you want to make software easy to work with.
It also matter if you don't want your software to have so many
technical debt that, two years later you will have to rewrite everything!

As I totally agree with it, there is still one thing I didn't realize at the moment.
I thaught it takes years or even have to be a huge programme to become complicated
to work with. The reality is that a couple of day a bad decisions can be enought and you project
don't even need to be huge.

How can you reconize bad decisions? When it's already too late.
And you can't expect to fix the all thing with some refactoring
unless you are paid for that.

Today I realize that the quality matter since the first bit of code we writing.
If we aren't quareful from the start, it will become out of control faster than expected.
