First week at 8th Light and what a week. The Friday is really special at 8th Light
it is really different than the other working day.

I was surprised this morning when Enrique ask me if I could pair with one
of our guest. Do I know how to do that? It's my first week at 8th Light!

I quickly decide to apply the ping pong rule, as it's the only one that I know.
One person write a test and the other one have to solve this test, then we invert the role.


We also had three workshop during the day:
- Comunication
- Consulting
- Deadline

Those weren't only interesting, they were really funny.

It make me feal that I should really improve my English, for exemple when a lot
of people talk in same time it can be really complicated and I hold back myself.

The day finished with a BBQ one the roof, but I sadly had to pass for this time.
I really needed a nap a this point!
