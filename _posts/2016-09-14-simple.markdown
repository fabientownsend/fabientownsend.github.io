It used to be said that the difference between a senior and junior was that a junior
will find a complicated solution for a simple problem, a senior will resolve
a complicated problem with a simple solution.

During the day, I asked Christoph for some advice concerning my project.
I was going deeper into the project and the deeper I went, the more questions
popped into my mind. Was the design of my code correct? Was it well tested?
Was my code's intention understandable? I didn't feel that I had found the best
solution and I wanted the perfect one.

I was even imagining how slow my software **could** become,
not about its current performance or how well it will perform in the future.

Christoph listened to me, I explain how I felt about it and why I felt frustrated
to not find the right solution. He explained me that I was over thinking a problem
that wasn't happening at the moment and that I shouldn't focus on a problem that
doesn't exist at present.

Without data, you can't focus on the right problem. I did not have any issues with
the performance and I was trying to solve it as though it was a problem before 
I even finished to make my solution work.

Make it work then make it fast.
