This morning Priya did a talk about blog editing. I enjoy the diversity of the talks,
being a craftman isn't just coding but rather a variety of skills.
Priya also presented us a cool tool call [HeminWayApp](www.hemingwayapp.com).
I will use it to help me to improve my writing as it hightlights complex sentences and common errors.

This morning I finally finished my first application: EchoServer.
I meet the target as I estimated this task 2.75 ideal hours, I hope it will be the same with my next task!

The afternoon I started to work on my Ruby version of the Tic-Tac-Toe. I enjoyed to worked on during my interview, it gave me the opportunity to improve skills like:

- Clean code
- Algorithm
- Architecture

It will be also a great way to learn Ruby.
Continuous Integration is such a great way to improve productivity and quality.
For that I tried to set up Travis, but it was a waste of time, I didn't figure out how to make it work.
I must ask someone more comfortable with ruby to avoid me to wast more time with it.
So far I enjoy using ruby, I can't wait to learn more about it.


ps: the person in charge to read my post just felt asleep, sorry for the grammar mistakes!
