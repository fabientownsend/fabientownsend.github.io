Tomorrow, we will try a new activity for 8th Light's apprentice. I'm excited
about it as it as it was on of my suggestion.

This activity will consist to solve problems, so far nothing new, but
the format will be completly different. During 15 minutes we will work
to solve a problem from "Cracking the coding Interview" with only one tool:
a whiteboard.

The main purpose is to improve the kind of questions we could ask abotu a new
problem and learn how to communicate a solution. These skills are important
when it comme to work in team.

These excercises will also help to improve our:

- Computer science skill
- Data structure skill
- Algorithm skill
