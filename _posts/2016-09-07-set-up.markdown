I received my work laptop yesterday.
I'm super happy with it but I also feel less productive with it since I never had the opportunity to use a mac.
It is just a matter of time to be more comfortable with it.

I started to install and configure my software after the really cool Zagaky by Sarah.
As I try to keep things simple, I only installed the software that I really need:

- vim
- tmux
- iTerm2

Do I really need anything else? For now, no, but I will ask my colleague what they use.
I may discover new really cool tools, and develop my way to work.

I saved a couple of hours of configuration by using my previous configurations that I hosted online on a [github repository](https://github.com/fabientownsend/echoserver).

In the afternoon, Christoph reviewed my [EchoServer](https://github.com/fabientownsend/echoserver),
I was impressed how quickly he offered suggestions to help me improve my work and how quickly he could answer all my questions.
It was really technical and showed confidence in his abilities.

After the second review with Christoph, I feel like I really need to be more
careful with these different points:

- Avoid global variable, even for my tests
- Avoid bad naming, even for a quick dirty check
- Keep my tests clean!

Oh, I nearly forgot to mention that today I didn't miss any buses, trains or get lost.
It's the first time and I feel we should celebrate!
