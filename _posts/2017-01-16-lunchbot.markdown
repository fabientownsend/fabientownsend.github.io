For the first time since I started my apprenticeship, I will work
on a project with another person.

We don't have the specific requirements of the project at the moment.
The project will be to build a Slack bot that could manage the request for
lunch on Fridays. It's not a lot of knowledge to work with but enough to learn
about the Slack API.

Good! Skim reading over the Slack documentation, creation of a web service
with Ruby/Sinatra, upload on Heroku, configuration of the autotification
OAuth and here we are, our bot replies *Hello* when speak to it.

We haven't done much, and what we have done is quite basic. For now, we have
enough information to be able to estimate our future tasks with the customer
tomorrow.
